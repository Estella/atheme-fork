Building from the Git repository
--------------------------------

The Atheme Git repository can be checked out using the following command:
  $ git clone --recursive 'https://github.com/atheme/atheme.git' atheme-devel
  $ cd atheme-devel

Atheme's Git repository depot can be browsed over the internet at the
following address: <https://github.com/atheme/atheme/>



Building from release tarballs
------------------------------

If you did not use Git, but received the GIT-Access.txt error anyway, this
means you downloaded the wrong source archive.

When downloading releases from GitHub, you MUST use the attached archive:

	atheme-7.x.x.tar.bz2

DO NOT use the "Source code (tar.gz)" links, as they're missing submodules.

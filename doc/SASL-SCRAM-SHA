Atheme IRC Services version 7.3 and above supports SASL SCRAM-SHA logins.

Some work needs to be performed by the prospective IRC network administrator
to enable this. The 5 main steps to perform are:

1) Build Atheme with GNU libidn support (./configure --with-libidn)

2) Load modules/crypto/pbkdf2v2 *before* any other crypto module

   This ensures that it will become the primary crypto provider

3) Decide which SCRAM mechanism you want to use *

4) Configure pbkdf2v2 to generate SCRAM-SHA hashes (atheme.conf):

   pbkdf2v2 {
       digest = "SCRAM-SHA-256"; /* or "SCRAM-SHA-1" */
       rounds = ...;             /* between 10000 and 65536 ** */
   }

5) Load modules/saslserv/scram-sha

 * It is highly recommended that you choose SCRAM-SHA-256. You cannot enable
   both. SCRAM-SHA-1 is only supported to comply with RFC 5802, which states
   that supporting SHA-1 is required. However, all modern client SASL libraries
   that support SCRAM, support SCRAM-SHA-256 (RFC 7677), and any new client
   implementations are expected to as well. You should only choose SCRAM-SHA-1
   if you have a large user base that wants to use SCRAM but whom cannot use
   SCRAM-SHA-256.

** Inclusive. The popular Cyrus SASL client library will refuse to perform a
   PBKDF2 calculation with an iteration count greater than 65536, and the
   pbkdf2v2 crypto module will refuse an iteration count lower than 10000.
